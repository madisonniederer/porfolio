                <h3 id="courses">Relavent Coursework</h3>
                <p><b>Data Structures & Algorithms:</b> In the course, we covered topics related to algorithms including recussion, algorithm analysis,
                search and sorting algoithms. We implemented data structures in Java including Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, and Heaps, 
                and learned about traversal and data analysis using data structures.</p>

                <p><b>Software Development:</b> In my software development course, we discussed the process of designing, modeling, implementing, debuging, and deploying software for
                clients. We also covered UML and how to model our software. For the semester long project in the course,
                we designed our own software and completed documentation of the requirement elicitation, design process, models of the software, and the functional priorities of the software.
                More information on the project can be found in the experience section below </p>

                <p><b>Theory of Database Systems: </b>In the couse, we covered modeling, designing, building, and interfacing databases. 
                In addition to this, we covered information storage and quering using SQL.</p>

                <p><b>Programming Practicum: </b>In my Programming Practiucum course, we covered how to transfer skills and quickly learn Object Oriented
                Programming languages. We used previous knowledge in Java to quickly master C# and programming concepts like
                polymorphism, encapsulation using delegates and anonymous methods, lambda expressions, and LINQ.</p>

                <p><b>Computer Organization & Architecture: </b> In the course, we learned about computer systems organization, and architecture, focusing on, representation
                of data, instructions sets, addressing modes, digital logic, logic circuits, logic devices, memory,
                register transfer, and alternative architectures. By understanding the computer organization at lowest level through
                understanding machine and assembly language, we can build more efficent and effective high-level language programs.</p>
