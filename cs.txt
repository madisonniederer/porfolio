Coursework:
Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Development, Theory of Database Systems, Programming Practicum, 
    Comp Organization & Architecture

Data Structures & Algorithms: In the course, we covered topics related to algorithms including recussion, algorithm analysis,
search and sorting algoithms. We implemented data structures in Java including Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, and Heaps, 
and learned about traversal and data analysis using data structures.

Software Development: In my software development course, we discussed the process of designing, modeling, implementing, debuging, and deploying of software for
clients includingly lifecycle of software. We also covered UML and how to model our software. For the semester long project in the course,
we designed our own software and completed documentation of the requirement elicitation, design process, models of the software, and the functional priorities of the software.
More info on the project in the experience section below 

Theory of Database Systems: In the couse, we covered modeling, designing, building, and interfacing Databases. 
In addition to this, we covered information storage and quering using SQL.

Programming Practicum: In my Programming Practiucum course, we covered how to transfer skills and quickly learn Object Oriented
Programming languages. We used previous knowledge in Java to quickly master C# and programming concepts like
polymorphism, encapsulation using delegates and anonymous methods, lambda experssions...

Computer Organization & Architecture: Covered computer systems, organization, and architecture. Focusing on, representation
of data, instructions sets, addressing modes, digital logic, logic circuits, logic devices, memory,
register transfer, and alternative architectures. By understanding the computer organization at lowest level, through
understanding Machine and assembly language we can build more efficent and effective high-level language programs.
